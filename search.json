Mathematically, we write it \\(\\Xi^{N}(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_1^N {\\xi(\\omega_N; \\theta_0, \\theta_1)}\\). Check empirically that standard deviation of these draws decrease proportionally to \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) .\n__Using a high enough number for N, compute optimal values for \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). What is the matching value for the objective function converted into an equivalent stream of determinstic consumption ? That is if V is the approximated value computed above, what is \\(\\bar{c}\\in \\R\\) such that $ V= _{t=0}^T ^t U({c})$ ?__\nUsing a high enough number for N, make contour plots of lifetime rewards as a function of θ_0 and θ_1. Ideally, represent lines with \\(1\\%\\) consumption loss, \\(5\\%\\) and \\(10\\%\\) deterministic consumption loss w.r.t. to maximum.\n\n\nLearning to save\nWe now focus on the number of steps it takes to optimize \\(\\theta_0\\), \\(\\theta_1\\).\nImplement a function ∇(θ::Vector; N=1000)::Vector which computes the gradient of the objective w.r.t. θ==[θ_0,θ_1]. (You need to use automatic differentiation, otherwise you might get incorrect results).\nImplement a gradient descent algorithm to maximize \\(\\Xi^N(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\) using learning rate \\(\\lambda \\in ]0,1]\\). Stop after a predefined number of iterations. Compare convergence speed for different values of \\(\\lambda\\) and plot them on the \\(\\theta_0, \\theta_1\\) plan. How many steps does it take to enter the 1% error zone? The 5% and the 10% error zone?\nEven for big N, the evaluated value of ∇ are stochastic, and always slightly inaccurate. In average, they are non-biased and the algorithm converges in expectation (it fluctuates around the maximum). This is called the stochastic gradient method.\nWhat are the values of \\(N\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) which minimize the number of iterations before reaching the target zones (at 1%, 2%, etc…)? How many simulations periods does it correspond to? Would you say it is realistic that consumers learn from their own experience?"

    "text": "I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, “Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from?” The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word “research”. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let’s kill two birds with one stone. Let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it’s impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n\n— Richard Bellman, Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography (1984, page 159)",

Use it to differentiate the function below. Check the jacobian function.\nNote: the signature of function f needs to be fixed first to allow for dual numbers as arguments.\nCreate a NamedTuple to hold the model parameters.\nDefine two functions: - transition(z::Number, k::Number, i::Number, p)::Tuple{Number} which returns productivity and capital at date t+1 as a function of productivity, capital and investment at date t - arbitrage(z::Number, k::Number, i::Number, Z::Number, K::Number, I::Number, p)::Number which returns the residual of the euler equation (lower case variable for date t, upper case for date t+1)\nUsing multiple dispatch, define two variants of the same functions, that take vectors as input and output arguments: - arbitrage(s::Vector{T}, x::Vector{T}, S::Vector{T}, X::Vector{T}, p) where T&lt;:Number - transition(s::Vector{T}, x::Vector{T}, p) where T&lt;:Number\nWrite a function steady_state(p)::Tuple{Vector,Vector} which computes the steady-state of the model computed by hand. It returns two vectors, one for the states, one for the controls. Check that the steady-state satisfies the model equations.\nThe first order system satisfies: \\[\\begin{align}A s_t + B x_t + C s_{t+1} + D x_{t+1} & = & 0 \\\\\\\\\ns_{t+1} & = & E s_t + F x_t\n\\end{align}\\]\nDefine a structure PerturbedModel to hold matrices A,B,C,D,E,F.\nWrite a function first_order_model(s::Vector, x::Vector, p)::PerturbedModel, which returns the first order model, given the steady-state and the calibration. Suggestion: use ForwardDiff.jl library.\nWe look for a linear solution \\(x_t = X s_t\\) . Write the matrix equation which X must satisfy. Write a function residual(X::Array, M::PerturbedModel) which computes the residual of this equation for a given X.\nWrite a function T(X, M::PerturbedModel) which implements the time iteration step.\nWrite function linear_time_iteration(X_0::Matrix, m::PerturbedModel)::Matrix which implements the time iteration algorithm. Apply it to X0 = rand(1,2) and check that the result satisfies the first order model.\nCheck blanchard Kahn Conditions\nDefine two linear operators L_S(U::Union{Vector, Matrix}, X_0::Matrix, m::PerturbedModel)::Matrix and L_T(U::Matrix, X_0::Matrix, m::PerturbedModel)::Matrix which implement the derivatives of the simulation and the time-iteration operator respectively.\nImplement a function spectral_radius(f::Function)::Float64 which implements the power iteration method to compute the biggest eigenvalues of the two previously defined operators. Check that Blanchard-Kahn conditions are met.\nWrite a function simulate(s0::Vector, X::Matrix, p, T::Int64)::Tuple{Matrix, Matrix} to simulate the model over \\(T\\) periods (by using the formula \\(\\Delta s_t = (E + F X) \\Delta s_{t-1}\\). Return a matrix for the states (one line per date) and another matrix for the controls. Bonus: add a keyword option to compute variables levels or log-deviations.

    "text": "Part I : A simple CGE model\nThe goal of this exercise consists in solving a simple CGE model using Julia.\nModel is taken from Handbook of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling. 1\n\nThe data and the social accounting matrix\nIn a CGE, the data about the economy’s exchanges is compiled in one single “Social Accounting Matrix”. It is essentially a matrix representation of the national accounts that can be arbitrary refined based on data availability.\nIn this course work we consider the following simplified version. All items are in million euros.\n\n\n\nSAM\nBRD\nMLK\nCAP\nLAB\nHOH\n\n\n\n\nBRD\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nMLK\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nCAP\n5\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nLAB\n10\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nHOH\n\n\n25\n25\n\n\n\n\nIn this table, there are 5 sectors:\n\nTwo Goods: BRD and MLK\nTwo Factors: CAP and LAB (capital and labour)\nOne Agent: HOH (Households)\n\nEach of the rows feature a decomposition of the spending associated with each column.\nFor instance, the value of the production in the BRD-producing sector (column BRD) is decomposed between the payment to capital (5) and the payment to labor (10). The full capital income goes to households (25). Households spend their income between BRD (15) and MLK (35.)\n\nCreate a DataFrame representing the SAM matrix.\n\n\nusing DataFrames\n\nSAM = ...\n\n\n\nNotations\nTo shorten notations while preserving readibility we associate conventional indices to each sector: \\(i \\in \\text{BRD,MLK}\\), \\(j\\in \\text{BRD,MLK}\\), \\(h \\in \\text{CAP,LAB}\\)).\nTo model the economy, we will assume that endowments \\(F_h\\) are in fixed quantities (so \\(F_{BRD}\\) and \\(F_{MLK}\\) are two fixed parameters.)\nWe use the following notations:\n\n\\(X_i\\) household consumption of good i\n\\(F_{h,j}\\) the h-th factor input by firm j\n\\(Z_{j}\\) output of the j-th good\n\\(p^x_{i}\\) demand price of the i-th good\n\\(p^z_{j}\\) supply price of the i-th good\n\\(p^f_{h}\\) the h-th factor price\n\nOur goal is to endogenize all these variables (there are 14 of them), by constructing a system of equations corresponding to the model we describe below.\nWe also denote by a zero exponent, the variables at the initial steady-state. For instance, \\(X_{BRD}^0\\) is the household consumption of good \\(BRD\\). We assume that the SAM corresponds to values observed at the initial steady-state.\n\n\nConsumers\nHouseholds are endowed with capital (resp labour) in quantity \\(F_{CAP}\\) resp \\(F_{LAB}\\)) that they sell to the goods producing firms at price \\(p^f_{CAP}\\) (resp \\(p^f_{LAB}\\)).\nGiven prices of goods \\(p^x_i\\), households maximize utility of consumption \\[U = \\prod_i X_i^{\\alpha_i}\\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the share parameter in the utility function (with \\(\\sum_i \\alpha_i=1\\))\n\nWrite down the budget constraint of households. Show that household’s demand can be written as function of total gdp and price of goods as in \\[X_i  = \\alpha_i\\frac{ \\sum_h  p^f_h F_h}{p^x_i}\\].\nAccording to the SAM matrix, what is the value of gdp in the model? How can we calibrate the values of \\(\\alpha_i\\)?\n\n\n\nProducers\nWe assume that producers of final goods, use the following production function:\n\\[Z_j   = b_j \\prod_h F_{h,j}^{\\beta_{h,j}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{h,j}\\) is the share parameter in production function (\\(\\sum_h \\beta_{h,j}=1\\)) and \\(b_j\\) is a scale parameter. Firms rent labour and capital at market price and are perfectly competitive.\n\nShow that factor demand function can be written as: \\[ F_{h,j} = \\beta_{h,j} \\frac{p^z_j Z_j }{p^f_h} \\]\nHow can we calibrate \\(\\beta_{h,j}\\) from the data? How can we recover \\(b_j\\)?\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that all prices are equal to 1 in the initial equilibrium. 2 What are then the values for endowments \\(F_h\\) consistent with the SAM? How can we calibrate the value of \\(b_j\\)?\n\n\n\nEquilibrium\nIn equilibrium we have the following conditions:\n\ndemand prices of the i-th good must match supply price of the same good: \\[p^x_{i} = p^z_{i}\\]\ngood markets must clear: \\[ X_i   = Z_i \\]\nfactor markets must clear: \\[ \\sum_j F_{h,j} = F_h \\]\nthe price of labour is taken as the numeraire \\(p_{LAB} = 1\\) (the other prices are endogenous).\n\n\n\n\nCalibration and solution\n\nDefine a structure model, containing the parameters of the model that can be directly calibrated from the data (i.e. \\(\\alpha_i\\),\\(\\beta_{ij}\\), \\(b_j\\), \\(F_h\\) …).\n\n\n## Choose the structure your prefer\n\n\nCreate an initial set of values vars0 for the model variables to be solved for. These variables should be consistent with the Social Accounting Matrix.\n\n\n## one suggestion consists in defining a named tuple of the form:\n\nvars0 = (;\n    X=(;\n        BRD=...,\n        MLK=...\n    ),\n    F=(;\n        LAB=(;\n            BRD=...,\n            MLK=...\n        )\n    ),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nWrite a function which packs the set of variable values into a julia vector. Write the reverse function to unpack a vector into a structure of the same type as vars. Check that these two functions are consistent (i.e. pack(unpack(u)) == u).\n\n\n# input argument should be the same as vars0\nfunction pack(vars)::Vector\n\n    # [X_BRD, X_MLK, F_LAB_BRD, ...]\nend\n\n\n# output argument should be the same as vars0\nfunction unpack(u::AbstractVector)\n\n    \nend\n\nunpack (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nWrite a function residuals which check whether the model equations are satisfied for a particular guess v0. The output can be a simple vector. Check the residuals for the initial guess vars0. They should be zeros is if the initial values and the model equations have been carefully chosen.\n\n\nfunction residuals(model, v)::Vector\n\n    # write down the model equations below\n    \n\nend\n\n\nAdd a new method to the function residuals, which now takes a vector as argument (using the unpack function). Compute the jacobian of that new function. Verify that the rank of this jacobian equals the number of variables to be determined. If the number of equations is greater than the number of variables to be determined, can you identify one equation that can be safely removed?.\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\nWrite a method to solve the system in all the endogenous variables when the initial guess is close to the initial equilibrium. You can use your method of choice (using your own code, using nlsolve, …). To ease convergence, you might want to take into account information about variable boundaries (all variables are positive).\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nA massive migration doubles the endowment of labour, which is now equal to 50. Assuming structural parameters are unchanged, Compute the new equilibrium using the same code as before. Comment on the changes in quantities and prices. Could you have predicted them?\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\nWhat happens if the labour share in both production sectors is reduced by 1%? (i.e. \\(\\beta_{LAB,j}\\) is reduced by 1%).\n\n\n# Your code"

    "text": "Part II: Cake-Eating Problem with Regeneration\n\nWe consider the following variant of the cake-eating problem. It can be interpreted as a model of sustainable consumption for a renewable resource.\nAn agent has a finite amount of cake \\(k_t\\) and must decide in each period how much of it to consume: \\(c_t\\in[0,k_t]\\).\nThe part of the cake that is not consumed degenerates at rate \\(\\delta\\) but new cake is also regenerated at rate \\(\\rho\\) so that the law of motion for the cake is:\n\\[k_{t+1}=\\delta (k_{t}-c_{t}) + \\rho\\]\nwith \\(\\delta\\in]0,1]\\) and \\(\\rho&gt;0\\)..\nThe goal is to maximize the present discounted value of utility over an infinite horizon:\n\\[\\sum_{t\\geq0} \\beta^t u(c_t)\\]\nwith \\(u(x) = \\frac{x^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}\\)\nWe can use the parameters \\(\\beta=0.95\\), \\(\\sigma=2\\), \\(\\delta=0.9\\).\n\nWhat is the maximal value \\(\\overline{K}\\) for the cake that can be obtained using natural regeneration? Choose \\(N&gt;0\\) and discretize the values for the cake into a vector \\(K=(K_1, ... ,K_N)\\) of linearly spaced values.\n\n# your code\n\nCreate a named tuple (or any other Julia construct) to store all parameters of the (discretized) model. In what follows, all Julia functions will take an additional parameter m carrying all these informations.\n\n# your code\nSince the transition for the cake is deterministic, we can identify the choice of consumption with the choice of next period cake. Here we will make the assumption that next period level must stay on the discretized grid.\nThis yields the following, discretized, Bellman equation \\[V(K_i) = \\max_{j \\in A(i)} U(K_i,K_j) + \\beta V(K_j)\\] where \\(A(i)\\) is the set of all possible cake indices that can be chosen for tomorrow given today’s index and where \\(U(K_i,K_j)\\) is utility obtained from consumption today.\n\nWhat is \\(U(K_i,K_j)\\)? Write a function U(a,b,m)::Float64 to represent it in Julia.\n\n# your code\n\nWrite a function A(i,m)::Tuple{Int, Int} which maps the index \\(i\\) of today’s cake \\(K_i\\) with a tuple containing the lowest and highest possible indices for the cake tomorrow.\n\n# your code\n\nMake an initial guess v0 for the value function represented (a vector of Float64 of length N) and an admissible guess x0 for the optimal choices (a vector of Int64 of length N).\n\n# your code\n\nFor the initial guess, plot the values and the consumptions against the size of the cake\n\n# your code\n\nWrite a function bellman_step(v::Vector{Float64}, m)::Tuple{Vector{Float64}, Vector{Int64}} which associates \\(\\tilde{V}(K_1), ..., \\tilde{V}(K_N)\\) to \\(V(K_1), ... V(K_N)\\) in \\[V(K_i) = \\max_{j \\in A(i)} U(K_i,K_j) + \\beta \\tilde{V}(K_j)\\] This function returns the new value and the controls resulting from the optimization.\n\n# your code\n\nImplement the value function algorithm to find the optimal consumption policy by iterating on Bellman step until convergence.\n\n# your code\n\nPlot the optimal consumption rule.\n\n# your code\n\nImplement the policy iteration algorithm.\n\n# your code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe policy iteration algorithm can be obtained from the value function algorithm: after each bellman step which yields a new policy rule \\(p(i)\\), compute the value of this policy, i.e. the value \\(V\\) such that:\n\\[V(K_i) = \\left. \\left\\{U(K_i,K_j) + \\beta V(K_j)\\right\\} \\right|_{j=p(i)}\\]\n\n\n\nComment on the results (interpret, vary the parameters, …)\n\n# your code",

    "text": "H.W. Heathcote: epidemiologic models are deterministic models for infectious diseases which are spread by direct person-to-person contact in a population.\nThis kind of models has been used since by a few decades by economist, for matters that have nothing to do with health.\n\ndiffusion of information, or opinions on social medias\nasset prices and fads\nexpectation formation for macroeconomic outcomes (ex: The Epidemiology of Macroeconomic Expectations by Chris Carroll)\n\nEpidemiologic models have two features that depart from standard economic models:\n\nAgent’s behaviour does not take the full system into account, an is irrational in the sense that it isn’t forward looking. Instead, an agent is given a behavioural heuristic.\nThe transitions of the whole system can be determined without solving for complex interactions first.\n\nUnderstanding why these two assumptions are very costly for economists will keep us busy during a big part of the course. Here we just consider two simple models as small programming exercises.\n\nSimple SIR model\nThere is a continuum of agents of mass \\(1\\). Each agent can be either “Susceptible” (S), “Infected” (I) or “Recovered” (R). In each period, one agent meets another agent drawn randomly. During a meeting Susceptible agents who meet an infected agent, will always catch the disease (or the fad) but are not contagious. Infected agents, have a probability \\(\\pi\\) of being recovered. Nothing happens to Recovered agents who meet other people. No distinction is made between recovering as a healthy or a dead person.\nWe’re interested in the evolution in the number infected persons, both the speed of infection and the total amount of infected people in every period.\nWrite down the transition equations for \\(n_I\\), the number of infected people, for \\(n_R\\) the number of recovered people and \\(n_S\\) the number of susceptible people.\nCompute the transition function f for the vector state \\(s_t\\) returning \\(s_{t+1}\\).\nCompute the transitions over \\(T\\) periods. Plot the result using Plots.jl. (bonus: check against closed form solution)\nWe now assume a Susceptible person who meets an infected one has a probability \\(\\mu\\) of catching the disease. Update the transition function \\(f\\) and write a function simulate of \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\pi\\) which returns the simulation. Compare different values of the parameters.

How would you choose parameters \\(\\Pi\\) and \\(\\mu\\)\n\n\nA Spatial SIR model\nWe now consider another version of the model where agents evolve in the space \\(\\mathcal{S}=[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\). There are \\(N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) agent. At any date, each agent \\(n \\in [0,1]\\) is located at \\((x_n,y_n)\\in \\mathcal{S}\\).\nEach agent moves follows a random walk bounded by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): \\[x_t = \\min(\\max( x_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, 0), 1)\\] \\[y_t = \\min(\\max( y_{t-1} + \\eta_t, 0), 1)\\] where \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are both normally distributed with standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\nAt any date, the individual state of an agent is \\(s_t=(x_t, y_t, h_t)\\) where \\(h_t\\) is either “S”, “I” or “R”. \\(v_t\\) denotes the states of all agents (for instance \\(v_t=(s_{n,t})_n\\). The health status of each agent is updated in the following way:\n\nAgents \\(R\\) stay \\(R\\).\nAgents \\(I\\) have probability \\(\\pi\\) to become \\(R\\). They stay \\(I\\) otherwise.\nAn agent of type \\(S\\) in position \\((x,y)\\) has a probability \\(prob(x,y,S)\\) to be infected that is \\(\\mu\\) if there is another infected agent within a radius \\(r&gt;0\\).\n\nDefine a type Agent, which holds the type of an agent. The state of the whole system will be held in a Vector[Agent] type.\nWrite a function spatial_transition(S::Vector{Agent})::Vector{Agent} to compute the transition of the positions. Write another function random_guess(T=100) which simulates for \\(T\\) periods in order to find a good initial guess.\nWrite a function show_population to plot all agents with different colors for different health status.\nWrite a function evolve(S::Vector[Agent])::Vector[Agent] which takes the population in a given state and returns the same population with updated health status.\nWrite a function simulate(S0::Vector[Agent], k=1) to simulate the economy starting from an initially random position with k infected individuals. The returned object should be of type Vector[Vector[Agent]].\nCompute statistics along a simulated path for \\(n_I\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_R\\).

There are \\(N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) agent. At any date, each agent \\(n \\in [0,1]\\) is located at \\((x_n,y_n)\\in \\mathcal{S}\\).\nEach agent moves follows a random walk bounded by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): \\[x_t = \\min(\\max( x_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, 0), 1)\\] \\[y_t = \\min(\\max( y_{t-1} + \\eta_t, 0), 1)\\] where \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are both normally distributed with standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\nAt any date, the individual state of an agent is \\(s_t=(x_t, y_t, h_t)\\) where \\(h_t\\) is either “S”, “I” or “R”. \\(v_t\\) denotes the states of all agents (for instance \\(v_t=(s_{n,t})_n\\). The health status of each agent is updated in the following way:\n\nAgents \\(R\\) stay \\(R\\).\nAgents \\(I\\) have probability \\(\\pi\\) to become \\(R\\). They stay \\(I\\) otherwise.\nAn agent of type \\(S\\) in position \\((x,y)\\) has a probability \\(prob(x,y,S)\\) to be infected that is \\(\\mu\\) if there is another infected agent within a radius \\(r&gt;0\\).\n\nDefine a type Agent, which holds the type of an agent. The state of the whole system will be held in a Vector[Agent] type.\nWrite a function spatial_transition(S::Vector{Agent})::Vector{Agent} to compute the transition of the positions. Write another function random_guess(T=100) which simulates for \\(T\\) periods in order to find a good initial guess.\nWrite a function show_population to plot all agents with different colors for different health status.\nWrite a function evolve(S::Vector[Agent])::Vector[Agent] which takes the population in a given state and returns the same population with updated health status.\nWrite a function simulate(S0::Vector[Agent], k=1) to simulate the economy starting from an initially random position with k infected individuals. The returned object should be of type Vector[Vector[Agent]].\nCompute statistics along a simulated path for \\(n_I\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_R\\). Plot and compare with the basic SIR model\n\n\nAdditional questions\nHave fun by trying to answer one of these questions:\n\nchange probability of infection so that it depends on the number of infected people in the vincinity (with some suitable functional formulation for)\ncompute an animation of the transition\ncompute an interactive visualisation (with Interact.jl if available)"
