    "section": "Learning the Consumption Rule",
    "text": "Learning the Consumption Rule\nThis exercise is inspired from Individual learning about consumption by Todd Allen and Chris Carroll link and from Deep Learning for Solving Economic models by Maliar, Maliar and Winant link\nWe consider the following consumption saving problem. An agent receives random income \\(y_t = \\exp(\\epsilon_t)\\) where \\(\\epsilon_t\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\sigma)\\) (\\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.)\nConsumer starts the period with available income \\(w_t\\). The law of motion for available income is:\n\\[w_t = \\exp(\\epsilon_t) + (w_{t-1}-c_{t-1}) r\\]\nwhere consumption \\(c_t \\in ]0,w_t]\\) is chosen in each period in order to maximize:\n\\[E_t \\sum_{t=0}^T \\beta^t U(c_t)\\]\ngiven initial available income \\(w_0\\).\nIn the questions below, we will use the following calibration:\n\n\\(\\beta = 0.9\\)\n\\(\\sigma = 0.1\\)\n\\(T=100\\)\n\\(U(x) = \\frac{x^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}\\) with \\(\\gamma=2\\)\n\\(w_0 = 1.1\\) (alternatively, consider values 0.5 and 1)\n\nThe theoretical solution to this problem is a concave function \\(\\varphi\\) such that \\(\\varphi(x)\\in ]0,x]\\) and \\(\\forall t,  c_t=\\varphi(w_t)\\). Qualitatively, agents accumulate savings, up to a certain point (a buffer stock), beyond which wealth is not increasing any more (in expectation).\nCarroll and Allen have noticed that the true solution can be approximated very well by a simple rule:\n\\(\\psi(x) = \\min(x, \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 (x - \\theta_0) )\\)\nThe main question they ask in the aforementioned paper is whether it is realistic that agents would learn good values of \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\) by observing past experiences.\nWe would like to examine this result by checking convergence of speed of stochastic gradient algorithm.\n\nLifetime reward\nDefine a NamedTuple to hold the parameter values\nDefine simple rule fonction consumption(w::Number, θ_0::Number, θ_1::Number, p::NamedTuple) which compute consumption using a simple rule. What is the meaning of \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\)? Make a plot in the space \\(w,c\\), including consumption rule and the line where \\(w_{t+1} = w_t\\).\n(remark for later: Number type is compatible with ForwardDiff.jl 😉)\nWrite a function lifetime_reward(w_0::Number, θ_0::Number, θ_1::Number, p::NamedTuple) which computes one realization of \\(\\sum \\beta^t U(c_t)\\) for initial wealth w_0 and simple rule θ_0, θ_1. Mathematically, we denote it by \\(\\xi(\\omega; \\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\), where \\(\\omega\\) represents the succession of random income draws.\nWrite a function expected_lifetime_reward(w_0::Number, θ_0::Number, θ_1::Number,  p::NamedTuple; N=1000) which computes expected lifetime reward using N Monte-Carlo draws. Mathematically, we write it \\(\\Xi^{N}(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_1^N {\\xi(\\omega_N; \\theta_0, \\theta_1)}\\). Check empirically that standard deviation of these draws decrease proportionally to \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\) .\n__Using a high enough number for N, compute optimal values for \\(\\theta_0\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\). What is the matching value for the objective function converted into an equivalent stream of determinstic consumption ? That is if V is the approximated value computed above, what is \\(\\bar{c}\\in \\R\\) such that $ V= _{t=0}^T ^t U({c})$ ?__\nUsing a high enough number for N, make contour plots of lifetime rewards as a function of θ_0 and θ_1. Ideally, represent lines with \\(1\\%\\) consumption loss, \\(5\\%\\) and \\(10\\%\\) deterministic consumption loss w.r.t. to maximum.\n\n\nLearning to save\nWe now focus on the number of steps it takes to optimize \\(\\theta_0\\), \\(\\theta_1\\).\nImplement a function ∇(θ::Vector; N=1000)::Vector which computes the gradient of the objective w.r.t. θ==[θ_0,θ_1]. (You need to use automatic differentiation, otherwise you might get incorrect results).\nImplement a gradient descent algorithm to maximize \\(\\Xi^N(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)\\) using learning rate \\(\\lambda \\in ]0,1]\\). Stop after a predefined number of iterations. Compare convergence speed for different values of \\(\\lambda\\) and plot them on the \\(\\theta_0, \\theta_1\\) plan. How many steps does it take to enter the 1% error zone? The 5% and the 10% error zone?\nEven for big N, the evaluated value of ∇ are stochastic, and always slightly inaccurate. In average, they are non-biased and the algorithm converges in expectation (it fluctuates around the maximum). This is called the stochastic gradient method.\nWhat are the values of \\(N\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) which minimize the number of iterations before reaching the target zones (at 1%, 2%, etc…)? How many simulations periods does it correspond to? Would you say it is realistic that consumers learn from their own experience?",

If you do this, however, you’ll be missing out on some of the biggest benefits of using Julia.\nIf you understand types, you can:\n\nWrite faster code\nWrite expressive, clear, and well-structured programs (keep this in mind when we talk about functions)\nReason more clearly about how your code works\n\nEven if you only use built-in functions and types, your code still takes advantage of Julia’s type system. That’s why it’s important to understand what types are and how to use them.\n\n# Example: writing type-stable functions\nfunction sumofsins_unstable(n::Integer)  \n    sum = 0:: Integer\n    for i in 1:n  \n        sum += sin(3.4)  \n    end  \n    return sum \nend  \n\nfunction sumofsins_stable(n::Integer)  \n    sum = 0.0 :: Float64\n    for i in 1:n  \n        sum += sin(3.4)  \n    end  \n    return sum \nend\n\n# Compile and run\nsumofsins_unstable(Int(1e5))\nsumofsins_stable(Int(1e5))\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\n\n@time sumofsins_unstable(Int(1e5))\n\n  0.000268 seconds\n\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\n\n@time sumofsins_stable(Int(1e5))\n\n  0.000130 seconds\n\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\nIn sumofsins_stable, the compiler is guaranteed that sum is of type Float64 throughout; therefore, it saves time and memory. On the other hand, in sumofsins_unstable, the compiler must check the type of sum at each iteration of the loop. Let’s look at the LLVM intermediate representation.\n\n\n\nSo far we have defined functions over argument lists of any type. Methods allow us to define functions “piecewise”. For any set of input arguments, we can define a method, a definition of one possible behavior for a function.\n\n# Define one method of the function print_type\nfunction print_type(x::Number)\n    println(\"$x is a number\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n# Define another method\nfunction print_type(x::String)\n    println(\"$x is a string\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n# Define yet another method\nfunction print_type(x::Number, y::Number)\n    println(\"$x and $y are both numbers\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 3 methods)\n\n\n\n# See all methods for a given function\nmethods(print_type)\n\n# 3 methods for generic function print_type: print_type(x::String) in Main at In[53]:3  print_type(x::Number) in Main at In[51]:3  print_type(x::Number, y::Number) in Main at In[54]:3 \n\n\nJulia uses multiple dispatch to decide which method of a function to execute when a function is applied. In particular, Julia compares the types of all arguments to the signatures of the function’s methods in order to choose the applicable one, not just the first (hence “multiple”).\n\nprint_type(5)\n\n5 is a number\n\n\n\nprint_type(\"foo\")\n\nfoo is a string\n\n\n\nprint_type([1, 2, 3])\n\nMethodError: MethodError: no method matching print_type(::Array{Int64,1})\nClosest candidates are:\n  print_type(!Matched::String) at In[53]:3\n  print_type(!Matched::Number) at In[51]:3\n  print_type(!Matched::Number, !Matched::Number) at In[54]:3\n\n\n\n\nJulia supports a short function definition for one-liners\n\nf(x::Float64) = x^2.0\nf(x::Int64) = x^3\n\nAs well as a special syntax for anonymous functions\n\nu-&gt;u^2\n\n\nmap(u-&gt;u^2, [1,2,3,4])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf(a,b,c=true; algo=\"newton\")\n\nUndefVarError: UndefVarError: f not defined\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we’ve seen, you can use Julia just like you use MATLAB and get faster code. However, to write faster and better code, attempt to write in a “Julian” manner:\n\nDefine composite types as logically needed\nWrite type-stable functions for best performance\nTake advantage of multiple dispatch to write code that looks like math\nAdd methods to existing functions\n\n\n\n\nHow is Julia so fast? Julia is just-in-time (JIT) compiled, which means (according to this StackExchange answer):\n\nA JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions) on the fly (or just-in-time, as it’s called) into a form that’s usually faster, typically the host CPU’s native instruction set. A JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn’t and can make better optimizations like inlining functions that are used frequently.\n\n\nThis is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles all the code to machine language before the program is first run.\n\nIn particular, Julia uses type information at runtime to optimize how your code is compiled. This is why writing type-stable code makes such a difference in speed!\n\n\n\n\nTaken from QuantEcon’s Julia Essentials and Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices lectures.\n\nConsider the polynomial \\[p(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_0 x^0\\] Using enumerate, write a function p such that p(x, coeff) computes the value of the polynomial with coefficients coeff evaluated at x.\nWrite a function solve_discrete_lyapunov that solves the discrete Lyapunov equation \\[S = ASA' + \\Sigma \\Sigma'\\] using the iterative procedure \\[S_0 = \\Sigma \\Sigma'\\] \\[S_{t+1} = A S_t A' + \\Sigma \\Sigma'\\] taking in as arguments the \\(n \\times n\\) matrix \\(A\\), the \\(n \\times k\\) matrix \\(\\Sigma\\), and a number of iterations.",

If you do this, however, you’ll be missing out on some of the biggest benefits of using Julia.\nIf you understand types, you can:\n\nWrite faster code\nWrite expressive, clear, and well-structured programs (keep this in mind when we talk about functions)\nReason more clearly about how your code works\n\nEven if you only use built-in functions and types, your code still takes advantage of Julia’s type system. That’s why it’s important to understand what types are and how to use them.\n\n# Example: writing type-stable functions\nfunction sumofsins_unstable(n::Integer)  \n    sum = 0:: Integer\n    for i in 1:n  \n        sum += sin(3.4)  \n    end  \n    return sum \nend  \n\nfunction sumofsins_stable(n::Integer)  \n    sum = 0.0 :: Float64\n    for i in 1:n  \n        sum += sin(3.4)  \n    end  \n    return sum \nend\n\n# Compile and run\nsumofsins_unstable(Int(1e5))\nsumofsins_stable(Int(1e5))\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\n\n@time sumofsins_unstable(Int(1e5))\n\n  0.000268 seconds\n\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\n\n@time sumofsins_stable(Int(1e5))\n\n  0.000130 seconds\n\n\n-25554.110202663698\n\n\nIn sumofsins_stable, the compiler is guaranteed that sum is of type Float64 throughout; therefore, it saves time and memory. On the other hand, in sumofsins_unstable, the compiler must check the type of sum at each iteration of the loop. Let’s look at the LLVM intermediate representation.\n\n\n\nSo far we have defined functions over argument lists of any type. Methods allow us to define functions “piecewise”. For any set of input arguments, we can define a method, a definition of one possible behavior for a function.\n\n# Define one method of the function print_type\nfunction print_type(x::Number)\n    println(\"$x is a number\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n# Define another method\nfunction print_type(x::String)\n    println(\"$x is a string\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\n\n# Define yet another method\nfunction print_type(x::Number, y::Number)\n    println(\"$x and $y are both numbers\")\nend\n\nprint_type (generic function with 3 methods)\n\n\n\n# See all methods for a given function\nmethods(print_type)\n\n# 3 methods for generic function print_type: print_type(x::String) in Main at In[53]:3  print_type(x::Number) in Main at In[51]:3  print_type(x::Number, y::Number) in Main at In[54]:3 \n\n\nJulia uses multiple dispatch to decide which method of a function to execute when a function is applied. In particular, Julia compares the types of all arguments to the signatures of the function’s methods in order to choose the applicable one, not just the first (hence “multiple”).\n\nprint_type(5)\n\n5 is a number\n\n\n\nprint_type(\"foo\")\n\nfoo is a string\n\n\n\nprint_type([1, 2, 3])\n\nMethodError: MethodError: no method matching print_type(::Array{Int64,1})\nClosest candidates are:\n  print_type(!Matched::String) at In[53]:3\n  print_type(!Matched::Number) at In[51]:3\n  print_type(!Matched::Number, !Matched::Number) at In[54]:3\n\n\n\n\nJulia supports a short function definition for one-liners\n\nf(x::Float64) = x^2.0\nf(x::Int64) = x^3\n\nAs well as a special syntax for anonymous functions\n\nu-&gt;u^2\n\n\nmap(u-&gt;u^2, [1,2,3,4])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf(a,b,c=true; algo=\"newton\")\n\nUndefVarError: UndefVarError: f not defined\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we’ve seen, you can use Julia just like you use MATLAB and get faster code. However, to write faster and better code, attempt to write in a “Julian” manner:\n\nDefine composite types as logically needed\nWrite type-stable functions for best performance\nTake advantage of multiple dispatch to write code that looks like math\nAdd methods to existing functions\n\n\n\n\nHow is Julia so fast? Julia is just-in-time (JIT) compiled, which means (according to this StackExchange answer):\n\nA JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions) on the fly (or just-in-time, as it’s called) into a form that’s usually faster, typically the host CPU’s native instruction set. A JIT has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn’t and can make better optimizations like inlining functions that are used frequently.\n\n\nThis is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles all the code to machine language before the program is first run.\n\nIn particular, Julia uses type information at runtime to optimize how your code is compiled. This is why writing type-stable code makes such a difference in speed!",

    "text": "I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, “Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from?” The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word “research”. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let’s kill two birds with one stone. Let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it’s impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n\n— Richard Bellman, Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography (1984, page 159)",

    "text": "Part I : A simple CGE model\nThe goal of this exercise consists in solving a simple CGE model using Julia.\nModel is taken from Handbook of Computable General Equilibrium Modeling. 1\n\nThe data and the social accounting matrix\nIn a CGE, the data about the economy’s exchanges is compiled in one single “Social Accounting Matrix”. It is essentially a matrix representation of the national accounts that can be arbitrary refined based on data availability.\nIn this course work we consider the following simplified version. All items are in million euros.\n\n\n\nSAM\nBRD\nMLK\nCAP\nLAB\nHOH\n\n\n\n\nBRD\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nMLK\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nCAP\n5\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nLAB\n10\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nHOH\n\n\n25\n25\n\n\n\n\nIn this table, there are 5 sectors:\n\nTwo Goods: BRD and MLK\nTwo Factors: CAP and LAB (capital and labour)\nOne Agent: HOH (Households)\n\nEach of the rows feature a decomposition of the spending associated with each column.\nFor instance, the value of the production in the BRD-producing sector (column BRD) is decomposed between the payment to capital (5) and the payment to labor (10). The full capital income goes to households (25). Households spend their income between BRD (15) and MLK (35.)\n\nCreate a DataFrame representing the SAM matrix.\n\n\nusing DataFrames\n\nSAM = ...\n\n\n\nNotations\nTo shorten notations while preserving readibility we associate conventional indices to each sector: \\(i \\in \\text{BRD,MLK}\\), \\(j\\in \\text{BRD,MLK}\\), \\(h \\in \\text{CAP,LAB}\\)).\nTo model the economy, we will assume that endowments \\(F_h\\) are in fixed quantities (so \\(F_{BRD}\\) and \\(F_{MLK}\\) are two fixed parameters.)\nWe use the following notations:\n\n\\(X_i\\) household consumption of good i\n\\(F_{h,j}\\) the h-th factor input by firm j\n\\(Z_{j}\\) output of the j-th good\n\\(p^x_{i}\\) demand price of the i-th good\n\\(p^z_{j}\\) supply price of the i-th good\n\\(p^f_{h}\\) the h-th factor price\n\nOur goal is to endogenize all these variables (there are 14 of them), by constructing a system of equations corresponding to the model we describe below.\nWe also denote by a zero exponent, the variables at the initial steady-state. For instance, \\(X_{BRD}^0\\) is the household consumption of good \\(BRD\\). We assume that the SAM corresponds to values observed at the initial steady-state.\n\n\nConsumers\nHouseholds are endowed with capital (resp labour) in quantity \\(F_{CAP}\\) resp \\(F_{LAB}\\)) that they sell to the goods producing firms at price \\(p^f_{CAP}\\) (resp \\(p^f_{LAB}\\)).\nGiven prices of goods \\(p^x_i\\), households maximize utility of consumption \\[U = \\prod_i X_i^{\\alpha_i}\\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the share parameter in the utility function (with \\(\\sum_i \\alpha_i=1\\))\n\nWrite down the budget constraint of households. Show that household’s demand can be written as function of total gdp and price of goods as in \\[X_i  = \\alpha_i\\frac{ \\sum_h  p^f_h F_h}{p^x_i}\\].\nAccording to the SAM matrix, what is the value of gdp in the model? How can we calibrate the values of \\(\\alpha_i\\)?\n\n\n\nProducers\nWe assume that producers of final goods, use the following production function:\n\\[Z_j   = b_j \\prod_h F_{h,j}^{\\beta_{h,j}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{h,j}\\) is the share parameter in production function (\\(\\sum_h \\beta_{h,j}=1\\)) and \\(b_j\\) is a scale parameter. Firms rent labour and capital at market price and are perfectly competitive.\n\nShow that factor demand function can be written as: \\[ F_{h,j} = \\beta_{h,j} \\frac{p^z_j Z_j }{p^f_h} \\]\nHow can we calibrate \\(\\beta_{h,j}\\) from the data? How can we recover \\(b_j\\)?\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that all prices are equal to 1 in the initial equilibrium. 2 What are then the values for endowments \\(F_h\\) consistent with the SAM? How can we calibrate the value of \\(b_j\\)?\n\n\n\nEquilibrium\nIn equilibrium we have the following conditions:\n\ndemand prices of the i-th good must match supply price of the same good: \\[p^x_{i} = p^z_{i}\\]\ngood markets must clear: \\[ X_i   = Z_i \\]\nfactor markets must clear: \\[ \\sum_j F_{h,j} = F_h \\]\nthe price of labour is taken as the numeraire \\(p_{LAB} = 1\\) (the other prices are endogenous).\n\n\n\n\nCalibration and solution\n\nDefine a structure model, containing the parameters of the model that can be directly calibrated from the data (i.e. \\(\\alpha_i\\),\\(\\beta_{ij}\\), \\(b_j\\), \\(F_h\\) …).\n\n\n## Choose the structure your prefer\n\n\nCreate an initial set of values vars0 for the model variables to be solved for. These variables should be consistent with the Social Accounting Matrix.\n\n\n## one suggestion consists in defining a named tuple of the form:\n\nvars0 = (;\n    X=(;\n        BRD=...,\n        MLK=...\n    ),\n    F=(;\n        LAB=(;\n            BRD=...,\n            MLK=...\n        )\n    ),\n    ...\n)\n\n\nWrite a function which packs the set of variable values into a julia vector. Write the reverse function to unpack a vector into a structure of the same type as vars. Check that these two functions are consistent (i.e. pack(unpack(u)) == u).\n\n\n# input argument should be the same as vars0\nfunction pack(vars)::Vector\n\n    # [X_BRD, X_MLK, F_LAB_BRD, ...]\nend\n\n\n# output argument should be the same as vars0\nfunction unpack(u::AbstractVector)\n\n    \nend\n\nunpack (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\nWrite a function residuals which check whether the model equations are satisfied for a particular guess v0. The output can be a simple vector. Check the residuals for the initial guess vars0. They should be zeros is if the initial values and the model equations have been carefully chosen.\n\n\nfunction residuals(model, v)::Vector\n\n    # write down the model equations below\n    \n\nend\n\n\nAdd a new method to the function residuals, which now takes a vector as argument (using the unpack function). Compute the jacobian of that new function. Verify that the rank of this jacobian equals the number of variables to be determined. If the number of equations is greater than the number of variables to be determined, can you identify one equation that can be safely removed?.\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\nWrite a method to solve the system in all the endogenous variables when the initial guess is close to the initial equilibrium. You can use your method of choice (using your own code, using nlsolve, …). To ease convergence, you might want to take into account information about variable boundaries (all variables are positive).\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nA massive migration doubles the endowment of labour, which is now equal to 50. Assuming structural parameters are unchanged, Compute the new equilibrium using the same code as before. Comment on the changes in quantities and prices. Could you have predicted them?\n\n\n# Your code\n\n\nWhat happens if the labour share in both production sectors is reduced by 1%? (i.e. \\(\\beta_{LAB,j}\\) is reduced by 1%).\n\n\n# Your code",

The health status of each agent is updated in the following way:\n\nAgents \\(R\\) stay \\(R\\).\nAgents \\(I\\) have probability \\(\\pi\\) to become \\(R\\). They stay \\(I\\) otherwise.\nAn agent of type \\(S\\) in position \\((x,y)\\) has a probability \\(prob(x,y,S)\\) to be infected that is \\(\\mu\\) if there is another infected agent within a radius \\(r&gt;0\\).\n\nDefine a type Agent, which holds the type of an agent. The state of the whole system will be held in a Vector[Agent] type.\nWrite a function spatial_transition(S::Vector{Agent})::Vector{Agent} to compute the transition of the positions. Write another function random_guess(T=100) which simulates for \\(T\\) periods in order to find a good initial guess.\nWrite a function show_population to plot all agents with different colors for different health status.\nWrite a function evolve(S::Vector[Agent])::Vector[Agent] which takes the population in a given state and returns the same population with updated health status.\nWrite a function simulate(S0::Vector[Agent], k=1) to simulate the economy starting from an initially random position with k infected individuals.

There are \\(N\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) agent. At any date, each agent \\(n \\in [0,1]\\) is located at \\((x_n,y_n)\\in \\mathcal{S}\\).\nEach agent moves follows a random walk bounded by \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): \\[x_t = \\min(\\max( x_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t, 0), 1)\\] \\[y_t = \\min(\\max( y_{t-1} + \\eta_t, 0), 1)\\] where \\(\\epsilon_t\\) and \\(\\eta_t\\) are both normally distributed with standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\).\nAt any date, the individual state of an agent is \\(s_t=(x_t, y_t, h_t)\\) where \\(h_t\\) is either “S”, “I” or “R”. \\(v_t\\) denotes the states of all agents (for instance \\(v_t=(s_{n,t})_n\\). The health status of each agent is updated in the following way:\n\nAgents \\(R\\) stay \\(R\\).\nAgents \\(I\\) have probability \\(\\pi\\) to become \\(R\\). They stay \\(I\\) otherwise.\nAn agent of type \\(S\\) in position \\((x,y)\\) has a probability \\(prob(x,y,S)\\) to be infected that is \\(\\mu\\) if there is another infected agent within a radius \\(r&gt;0\\).\n\nDefine a type Agent, which holds the type of an agent. The state of the whole system will be held in a Vector[Agent] type.\nWrite a function spatial_transition(S::Vector{Agent})::Vector{Agent} to compute the transition of the positions. Write another function random_guess(T=100) which simulates for \\(T\\) periods in order to find a good initial guess.\nWrite a function show_population to plot all agents with different colors for different health status.\nWrite a function evolve(S::Vector[Agent])::Vector[Agent] which takes the population in a given state and returns the same population with updated health status.\nWrite a function simulate(S0::Vector[Agent], k=1) to simulate the economy starting from an initially random position with k infected individuals. The returned object should be of type Vector[Vector[Agent]].\nCompute statistics along a simulated path for \\(n_I\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_R\\). Plot and compare with the basic SIR model\n\n\nAdditional questions\nHave fun by trying to answer one of these questions:\n\nchange probability of infection so that it depends on the number of infected people in the vincinity (with some suitable functional formulation for)\ncompute an animation of the transition\ncompute an interactive visualisation (with Interact.jl if available)"
