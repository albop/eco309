    "In the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans  model (also called neoclassical growth model), a representative agent would choose $c_t$ in every period so as to maximize an intertemporal utility like $\\sum_{t \\geq 0} \\beta^t U(c_t)$ where $\\beta \\in [0,1[$ is a time discount and $U(x)=\\frac{x^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$ is the instantaneous felicity.\n",
