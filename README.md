## Material

All the course material is written inside notebooks and markdown files (usually in `slides/`). Tutorial files (in `tutorial/`) are meant to be run and filled by students.

Each student is expected to have a clone of the course repository and update it at the beginning of each session. It is suggested to work on a copy of each file.
