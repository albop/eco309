## Roadmap

Each session is 4 hours, and is expected to be evenly but not contiguously divided between lectures and hands-on tutorials.

## Material

All the course material is written inside notebooks and markdown files (usually in `slides/`). Tutorial files (in `tutorial/`) are meant to be run and filled by students.
Slides are available [online](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/). (PRs are welcome)
- [introduction](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/)
- [convergence](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/convergence.html)
- [optimization](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/optimization.html)
- [perturbation](http://www.mosphere.fr/eco309/slides/perturbation.html)

Each student is expected to have a clone of the course repository and update it at the beginning of each session. It is suggested to work on a copy of each file.

During the course, each student will be asked to choose and present one Julia library.

The tutorial in the last session will be the final exam.

## Setup requirement

- To make the most of the course, it is recommended to install
  - Julia 1.7
  - A good text editor (strongly advised: Visual Studio Code)
  - Git
- As a plan B, it is possible to use the mybinder link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/albop/eco309.git/main?urlpath=lab)
  - be sure to save your work locally

### Communication for this Course

- github repository for the course: https://github.com/albop/eco309
- enroll by:
    - creating a github account if needed
    - cloning the repository
    - making a PR on students.md
- join on [Zulip](econforge.zulipchat.org) : we'll communicate in the `eco309_2022` room
    - you're welcome to ask questions and answer other's questions (nicely)
    - outside of the course hours, I'll answer when I can
- formal or infrequent communication: `pwinant@escp.eu` with subject starting with `[eco309]`

### Assignments and Final Exam

-  Hands-on tutorial started in class must be (reasonably) completed by Wednesday night.
   - option A: send them to me
   - option B: commit the work in your clone.
- There will be two special assignments with 14 days to complete each of them.
- Groupwork is OK.
- Final Exam will take place in the latest session.
    - It will consists of a few simple programming questions and a small model to solve yourself.
- Final Grade will weight everything
